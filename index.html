		fsnNarrative: "Ripple effects from the crisis in Ukraine threaten to deepen the food security crisis in Afghanistan, as the price of basic food commodities, fuel, and agricultural inputs surge. The price of wheat flour has increased by 24 percent since October 2021, while vegetable oil increased by 41 percent since March 2022 alone. ",
		wfpNarrative: "As a result, the cost of WFP’s commodity voucher food basket has increased by 17 percent since December 2021. WFP is experiencing, on average, a 4-6 month lead time for the procurement of food commodities, including wheat/wheat flour, yellow split peas and sunflower oil. Approximately 8 percent of all wheat flour procured was previously sourced from Russia. WFP is urgently working on new procurement contracts with neighboring countries to fill the gap. The feasibility study of opening a supply route from India through Iran is underway.\r\nWFP is facing lead times of up to 6 months for internationally procured commodities. Due to the impact of the crisis in Ukraine on global food and fuel prices, WFP requires USD 256 million more for food and transport in 2022. A shortfall of wheat flour is expected in July through the end of the year, as the 2023 lean season preparations begin. Shortfalls are primarily due to regional export bans and WFP is working to contract alternative sources.",

		countryName: "Bangladesh",
		fsnNarrative: "Bangladesh relies on imported wheat, vegetable oil and fertilizer to feed its 164.7 million inhabitants. Due to its reliance on imports, the country is likely to face rising food insecurity in the months ahead. The global food crisis – fuelled by the conflict in Ukraine and post-pandemic aftereffects – poses a serious threat to the local, regional and international markets that WFP relies on in Cox’s Bazar, and thus its provision of life-saving food assistance. Bangladesh was the third major export market for both Russian and Ukrainian wheat in 2020-21, importing 1.51 million mt of wheat from Ukraine and 1.94 million mt from Russia. India has also become a major supplier in recent years, making Bangladesh also vulnerable to India’s export bans. If the conflict continues to disrupt global markets, this volatility will spill over into the Bangladesh economy and further increase WFP’s operational costs.\r\nRegional developments are also threatening commodity prices and food access for the most vulnerable. On 28 April, Indonesia placed an embargo on palm oil exports, which comprise 80 percent of Bangladeshi palm oil imports. On 13 May, India then banned domestic exports of wheat and onion, which have sent local market prices of wheat and onion spiralling upwards in Cox’s Bazar. \r\nWFP anticipates that without timely intervention commodity price increases will make nutritious diets less affordable. On average, refugees currently spend 52 percent of their e-voucher entitlement on rice. If their current purchasing power is not maintained, WFP expects to see refugees spend a higher proportion of their entitlement on energy-dense cereals to minimize food costs, as opposed to micronutrient-rich fresh fruits, vegetables, and animal proteins. This means that many refugees will not meet their nutritional needs, which increases the risk of malnutrition, including micronutrient deficiencies.",
		wfpNarrative: "Implications\r\n- The April 2022 inflation rate reached 6.24 percent, and WFP expects this to further increase in the second quarter of 2022. Adjusting the existing food monthly expenditure basket (MEB) for the April rate of inflation means an increase from US$15.50 per person (established in November 2020), to US$ 16.50 per person.\r\n- The global food crisis is expected to further strain the global supply chain for specialized nutritious commodities, particularly Super Cereal (WSB+) and Super Cereal Plus (WSB++). These commodities – which are crucial for WFP’s curative and preventive nutrition programmes – have already experienced considerable pandemic-induced shortfalls in the past year, necessitating programme adaptations, including the implementation of half rations. WSB+ and WSB++ both have wheat as their base ingredient, and world wheat prices rose by 20 percent in March following the conflict in Ukraine. The rising cost of wheat will likely increase the cost of these crucial nutritious foods and will require WFP to either reduce the ration size or reduce the number of participants in its nutrition programmes, unless additional donor support is secured. \r\n- In May 2022, WFP had to abruptly provide a mid-month top-up to refugee households in the camps, due to a sudden nation-wide price hike in vegetable oil.\r\nResponse:\r\nAs the global food crisis worsens and commodity prices become unpredictable, WFP is exploring the deployment of various solutions to protect refugees’ purchasing power in Cox’s Bazar as much as possible:\r\n- Increase transfer value, where possible\r\n- Deduct at-risk item(s) from value voucher and distribute directly to refugees (e.g., 1 L of oil per person per month, no more and no less)\r\n- Maintain the same prices for refugees at outlet-level, but WFP to pay the market price difference to retailers directly\r\n- Increase market research capacity to forecast at-risk items in advance (where possible) to provide more lead time to temporarily switch to in-kind, where necessary\r\n- Assess the viability of alternative commodities to at-risk items, while maintaining nutritional value.\r\nThe above tools will not be mutually exclusive and can be deployed in parallel. All options have different risks (e.g. reversing a higher transfer value will likely not be feasible if/when prices decline), which will be evaluated carefully as WFP tries to proactively prepare for an unpredictable global economy",
		stakeholderNarrative: "So far, there has been no change in the Government's plan and allocation for social safety net programmes in Bangladesh.

		fsnNarrative: "The prices of consumer goods and services increased by 5.57 percent in the past 12 months (from March 2021 to March 2022). The month-on-month change has also increased slightly in March, mainly due to the 13 percent increase in the price of petrol and diesel. Food prices went up by 4.01 percent contributing to 36 percent of the overall inflation rate. Vegetables increased by 5.41 percent from previous month contributing to 0.57 percent increase for food groups. Among non-food items, transport recorded the highest increase, mostly attributed to the increase in price of petrol & diesel by about 40 percent from last year. (Bhutan Consumer Price Index) ",

It remains unclear how the situation could affect Russia’s contribution to the WFP DPRK in 2022 and onward, and in which currency (Ruble or USD). Due to the DPRK border closure, WFP has not been able to purchase food for more than two years, leaving a cumulative unspent balance of USD 25 million. Increasing food and fuel prices globally and rising international transportation costs have decreased WFP’s purchasing power of food commodities compared to the time of contributions received. It means, when WFP resumes operation/procurement, WFP will procure less quantity of food. As a result, WFP will have to reduce food ration or decrease the number of beneficiaries.",

Despite the conflict in Ukraine, domestic supplies have been maintained and wheat flour prices have not recorded a significant increase (only 1.7 percent between February and March). Global supply disruptions should be continually monitored as this may affect local wheat prices in the medium to long-term. Furthermore, Ukraine and Russia are the largest exporters of sunflower oil globally, while Indonesia is the top producer and exporter of palm oil, accounting for 56 percent of the total global supply. Potential shortages in sunflower oil supplies in the global market may shift the demand to palm oil triggering oil price rise, impacting affordability for vulnerable groups.",
		wfpNarrative: "WFP will continue to closely monitor the evolving situation of food commodity prices and the interventions implemented by the Government of Indonesia. Should the situation change, WFP may produce an updated Food Price Bulletin in the coming months based on secondary data analysis. \r\nWFP is also working with the Coordinating Ministry of Human Development and Cultural Affairs to facilitate the formation of a working group for essential goods and a national supply chain coordination platform for dialogue on supply chain issues. The working group and supply chain coordination platform aim to discuss and mitigate current and future supply chain disruptions to essential goods, including those potentially triggered by the conflict in Ukraine.",
		stakeholderNarrative: "The Government of Indonesia is committed to maintaining the national inflation rate between 2-5 percent. To do so, the National Food Agency (NFA) – one of WFP’s main partners – must maintain food stock availability and food prices. As per usual, the NFA is continuing to closely monitor the food stock and prices of the nine strategic commodities in Indonesia and providing transparency of data on their platform. Moreover, one of the interventions put in place by the NFA to prevent a rise in food prices is to provide a subsidy for maize and soybean producers. ",

		fsnNarrative: "The Kyrgyz Republic has a high dependency on Russian imports; out of the imported wheat, vegetable oil and sugar, 95 percent, 81 percent and 99 percent respectively, comes from the Russian Federation. In April 2022, inflation reached 14.5 percent compared to April 2021, the highest in the Eurasian Economic Union (EAEU) countries, and food inflation for staples is nearing 20 percent (Jan-April ’22 compared to the same period last year). While fuel prices appeared to remain somewhat constant between February 2022 to May 2022, they remain over 60 percent higher than in February 2021. As global fertilizer prices have risen nearly 30 percent since the start of 2022, following last year’s 80 percent surge, it is expected that rising input costs could impact next season’s harvest, leading to elevated food prices in the longer run. \r\nExpected developments: The Kyrgyz economy is highly dependent on remittances from the Russian Federation (80 percent of remittances originate from the Russian Federation), which made up 31 percent of the country’s economy (GDP) in 2020 and contributed to reducing the national poverty rate from 34.6 percent to 25.3 percent. Due to the recent sanctions on the Russian Federation, a drop of 33 percent in remittances to the Kyrgyz Republic is predicted for 2022, which may increase the poverty rate from 25 percent to up to 38 percent in 2022 (World  Bank), increasing the need for nutrition-sensitive shock-responsive social protection for a larger portion of the population.",
		wfpNarrative: "WFP will continue to monitor market prices for key commodities, including food and fuel, and work with national and local partners to tailor programmes to the needs of the most vulnerable and food insecure. A potential risk of rising prices is that WFP will need to procure wheat flour and oil from Russia at a higher cost, which could require additional funding. For school meals, this may include increasing advocacy for indexation of government’s contribution, promote and formalize community-contributions, prioritizing criteria to inform the type and extent of WFP assistance and its geographic scope etc. For FFA/FFT this may include re-evaluating food rations and transfer values based on resource availability to enable prioritization of assistance, improving targeting approaches, relevant social registries, and transfer platforms and digital systems for delivery of more responsive assistance. WFP will develop prioritization mechanisms for projects in case of funding constraints. Additionally, the Country Office is actively fundraising for the Emergency Response Outcome 5 introduced in the COVID-19 response to scale-up CBT and social protection support, in case of further shocks to vulnerable populations. WFP also provided policy and technical support to replicate the piloted Social Contract nationwide, and to develop a policy framework for the “Meken Chakyrygy” public works programme of the state anti-crises plan. ",
		stakeholderNarrative: "On 12 March 2022, the Government adopted an anti-crisis plan of KGS 126 billion (USD 1.58 billion), which includes subsidies for agriculture credits, land tax exemptions, wheat grain and flour import tax exemptions, bans on the export of basic food commodities, a nationwide programme of paid public works \"Meken Chakyrygy\" to provide temporary employment for hundreds of thousands of people, and increase social benefits and salaries of employees such as social workers.",

		fsnNarrative: "Fuel costs were already rising in Myanmar, with the conflict in Ukraine exacerbating the situation. Prices increased 18 percent between February and March this year, driven by global uncertainty, the conflict in Ukraine, and local conditions. In early May, average fuel prices were more than double those registered in February 2021 (+138 percent), according to WFP’s April Market Price update. The increase in fuel prices has caused transport costs to rise – a key driver of increasing retail food prices. The cost of a basic food basket increased by 14 percent between February and April. Compared to the same time last year, the average cost of a basic food basket is up 31 percent. Edible oil prices have risen by 37 percent between January and April, due to high transport costs, volatility in local exchange rates, and conflict in Myanmar. The average price of rice increased 10 percent from January to April with rising prices felt nearly everywhere in the country. Rising fertilizer prices could drive food prices higher still; while Myanmar mainly imports fertilizer from China, the conflict in Ukraine is expected to have knock-on effects on the availability and price of fertilizer in Myanmar.",
		wfpNarrative: "WFP will continue to use its monthly market updates to monitor the costs of food and fuel, and work with field offices and partners to identify potential activity adaptations. These may include adjusting transport contracts and increasing the value of cash-based transfers to meet the basic needs of beneficiaries. WFP also continues to allow more lead time for the procurement of food and nutrition rations. A potential risk of rising prices is that WFP will need to procure rice and other commodities from international markets at a higher cost. This would require additional funding or reducing relief assistance coverage.",
		stakeholderNarrative: "WFP Myanmar is not partnering with the de facto authorities on programming. The Myanmar Food Security Cluster, housed within WFP, continues to monitor food security in the country. Their research shows that in Myanmar it is difficult to separate the impact of the Ukraine conflict from the ongoing impacts of the military takeover in February 2021 and lingering effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. The Cluster has advised partners to expect an increase in costs of up to 40 per cent and to budget accordingly. Cluster leads are also concerned that rising costs will increase activity support costs, which will require budget adjustments that may have a negative impact on the number of beneficiaries reached in 2022. Further, with the Humanitarian Response Plan critically underfunded in 2022, Cluster partners may have to reduce staff numbers. If so, it is likely to be even more difficult for them to implement food security initiatives without adequate staff support.",

		fsnNarrative: "The crisis is exacerbating the poor financial situation in Nepal, with rising inflation and widening current account deficits already deteriorating as a result of the prolonged pandemic. While Nepal’s direct exposure to Russia and Ukraine is largely limited, the secondary impacts of the crisis are significant due to its landlocked location. Rising food and fuel prices, export bans, and supply chain limitations for cereals, vegetable oils and fertilizers out of Ukraine and Russia, could negatively impact food supply and ultimately push food even further out of reach for the most vulnerable people. The World Bank estimates that the current account deficit as a share of GDP will widen by around 1.5 percentage points in FY22 and FY23 relative to the January 2022 forecast. Transportation prices, construction costs, and other consumer prices are rising, which will dampen overall demand and in turn reduce the real GDP growth rate by an estimated 0.2 and 0.6 percentage points in FY22 and FY23, respectively. Services exports are expected to be less affected given the relatively low share of tourist arrivals from these two countries. Since the beginning of the year, prices of petroleum products, including fuel and gas have increased by 48 percent across the country. The Nepal Oil Corporation – the only provider of petroleum products in Nepal – continues to increase prices every fortnight.  In Nepal, the Government expects the price of agricultural products to increase due to fertilizer shortages and China and Russia’s export bans. Furthermore, on 22 May, India announced a ban on wheat exports, effective immediately. While the impact of this ban isn’t likely to be felt in Nepal immediately, experts warn that problems from this could emerge in the next three months. \r\nAs noted in WFP’s latest Nepal market update (April 2022), year-on-year inflation as measured by the Consumer Price Index (CPI) has risen to 7.28 percent from 7.14 percent in March. Inflation of food and beverages increased by 7.4 percent, while increases were also seen for ghee and edible oils (28.36 percent), as well as milk products and eggs (11.56 percent). Similarly, retail prices of most food commodities monitored in 15 major markets across the country showed an upward trend. Year-on-year trends of retail prices show an increase in prices for vegetables such as cabbage (41.1 percent) and tomato (38.5 percent), lentil (22.9 percent), soybean oil (29.1 percent) and apple (18.3 percent).",
		wfpNarrative: "Increasing prices of global commodities will likely contribute to increased food insecurity in Nepal too. At the same time, operations costs for WFP will also go up, constraining its response at a time when people need it most, especially with the monsoon predicted to be above average in 2022. In Nepal, WFP will continue with regularly monthly monitoring, as well as additional rapid market monitoring in-house where to look at key market functionality (supply, demand, availability, transport), prices and will add macro indicators. Primary data will be collected after the elections and released in early June.. Lastly, WFP’s mVAM household survey round is scheduled to be ready by July, with data collection planned for end of May to June. This survey will provide a picture on the prevalence of food insecurity in Nepal.  Previous reports available below.",
		stakeholderNarrative: "Immediate impacts on WFP operations will include delays in procurement. In addition, the rising costs of fuel will surge food prices affecting vulnerable communities in hard-to-reach areas in WFP programmes such as the mother and child health and nutrition programme.  On 24 May 2022, the Government announced their plans to ensure economic stability - ahead of projected further price hikes in food and non-food commodities – through the promotion of domestic production and consumption, supporting the agriculture, forest and mining industry by connecting them with the processing industry, and a programme to increase production of food commodities which are being imported in large scale (start date of these interventions are unknown). It is so far not fully clear what concrete plans or relief packages the Government and development partners are putting in place to assist the vulnerable population.",

		fsnNarrative: "Direct dependence on wheat from Ukraine is very limited for the Pacific Island Countries and Territories (PICT), except for the Republic of the Marshall Islands. The Solomon Islands is highly dependent on food imports and has a high level of food insecurity (as well as high dependence on imported fuel, high financial vulnerability, and low levels of income). Pacific wheat is mostly imported from Australia but is impacted by global food prices. For most PICTs the impacts will be felt through a rise in the prices of raw materials and fuels. For example, food and fuel inflation have seen a sharp increase in the last two months in Fiji.",
		wfpNarrative: "WFP Pacific MCO does not conduct food assistance procurement and distribution operations in the Pacific. However, since 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, WFP is implementing the mVAM tool on a quarterly basis in five countries in the Pacific (Fiji, Samoa, Tonga, Vanuatu and Kiribati) to provide timely access to information on household food security indicators as well as livelihood coping strategies. This supports evidence-based policy and program responses for decision-makers and is commonly used by donors and partners before and after a disaster to understand trends and inform humanitarian assistance programming. The latest available data was collected before the beginning of the crisis; however, the next rounds should capture the potential impacts of the conflict in Ukraine on food security in the coming months. \r\nIn addition, the regional Pacific Food Security Cluster (rPFSC) co-led by WFP is monitoring through its members the impact of the crisis in the Pacific.",
		stakeholderNarrative: "UN coordination and UN agencies, regional knowledge organizations such as the South Pacific Commission (SPC), and others are monitoring the impacts of the crisis on the implementation of SDGs in the Pacific. For example, in Fiji, to limit the impact on livelihoods, the Government implemented legislation to reduce vat to zero on 21 essential food items (end of March).",

		fsnNarrative: "The conflict in Ukraine’s ramifications across the global food chain will impact Pakistan, where the economy is already reeling from the detrimental impact of rising fuel and food prices, along with recurring disasters caused by climatic extremes. The recent intense heatwaves in Pakistan have put the lives of millions at risk while causing irreparable damage to the livelihoods of many. The agricultural sector has also taken a major hit, with summer crops such as wheat and pulses wilting under the blazing sun. \r\nAs the Pakistani Rupee continues to plummet, surpassing the threshold of PKR 200 to a dollar in May 2022, the resultant economic impact is likely to hit the poorest segments of the economy the most. According to ‘Pakistan Social and Living Standard Measurement Survey 2019-2020’ the number of food insecure people in Pakistan stands at 34 million. This number is likely to rise due to the reduction in food supplies, rising food and fuel prices and inflation. Headline inflation based on the Consumer Price Index (CPI) increased in April 2022 by 1.61 percent over March 2022 and increased by 13.37 percent over April 2021. CPI food inflation in April 2022 increased by 17.04 percent over April 2021. (Further information is available in the Market Monitor Report for May 2022). As yet, the outlook provided by the Ministry of Agriculture, Government of Pakistan remains positive, indicating nearly adequate availability of food to meet the country’s need. However, against a backdrop of high levels of food security and undernutrition, weak food systems and significant disparities in the access and availability of food, there are serious concerns, particularly for the poor and marginalized population groups of across the country.",
		wfpNarrative: "The crisis has led to supply disruptions which have seriously impacted the availability of fortified vegetable oil for WFP’s standard food basket, and in some cases, oil will not be distributed along with the food rations (thereby resulting in a decline in its caloric and monetary value). Rising food prices have also devalued cash disbursements being made under WFP’s CBT programmes. The cost of WFP’s food basket has also increased by 30 percent since January 2022. \r\nPakistan’s wheat requirement is around 30 million tons, but agriculturalists and authorities fear that the country’s wheat production may not exceed 26 million metric tons due to extreme drought and ultra-high temperatures in the month of March 2022. While WFP in Pakistan rarely needs to import wheat internationally for its operations, this shortage could lead to a need for further wheat imports. The substantial hike in global wheat prices could have implications for WFP’s food basket in Pakistan as well.",
		stakeholderNarrative: "The value of the stipend provided to the poorest quintile of the population registered in the Kafaalat component of the Government’s largest social safety net programme, the Benazir Income Support Programme (BISP) has declined exponentially. The cash entitlement under the BISP has also devalued due to the declining value of the Pakistani Rupee and escalating food prices. WFP and other humanitarian organizations have made recommendations to the new Government’s availability of funds for the poorest quintile through BISP Kafaalat (as was done in the immediate aftermath of COVID-19). The Benazir Nashonuma programme (BNP) is critical in reducing poverty and reaching the most vulnerable segments of the population, including women as well as children under two years of age. \r\nIn order to protect current development gains and prevent more people from being pushed into chronic food insecurity status, WFP is continuing engagement with the National Socio-Economic Registry (NSER) to incorporate the latest Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) information into targeting and programming for the BISP. This will maximize the prospects of inclusion for the most affected and vulnerable families for support, thereby circumventing a further deterioration in their food and nutrition security.",

The Philippines Department of Agriculture also launched ‘Plant, Plant, Plant Program 2’ to mitigate the effects of the global economic challenges compounded by the Ukraine crisis, while boosting local food production. The bulk of the program’s budget (PHP 24 billion) has been allocated for fertilizer subsidies.",

Multiple factors are colliding to amplify the pressure, from unfavorable harvests and widespread shortages of key imported commodities, to extremely volatile prices. The global economic crisis is set to only exacerbate the situation. Over one-third of people are already facing moderate or severe food insecurity (CARI). Low-income households are hardest hit, and some 86 percent of surveyed households are already turning to negative coping strategies such as buying cheaper food, reducing portions or skipping meals (according to the latest WFP-Government joint assessments).",

The result is a significant deterioration in the food security situation. The proportion of food insecure households is expected to increase from 20 percent in 2021 to as high as 36 percent should Russian economy suffer a contraction. Domestically, prices of some key food commodities continued to rise throughout 2021 across major markets in Tajikistan. This included wheat flour, cotton and vegetable oil, and meat, as well as fuel (petrol and diesel). In 2022, prices of some commodities have risen after the Russian invasion of Ukraine, including wheat, sugar, cooking oil as well as fuel. As of 28 March 2022, compared to a month before, prices of petrol and diesel rose by 19 and 21 percent respectively, wheat flour by 15 percent, sugar by 16 percent and vegetable oil by 5 percent.",
