                fsnNarrative: "Ripple effects from the crisis in Ukraine threaten to deepen the food security crisis in Afghanistan, as the price of basic food commodities, fuel, and agricultural inputs surge. The price of wheat flour has increased by 24 percent since October 2021, while vegetable oil increased by 41 percent since March 2022 alone. ",
                wfpNarrative: "As a result, the cost of WFP’s commodity voucher food basket has increased by 17 percent since December 2021. WFP is experiencing, on average, a 4-6 month lead time for the procurement of food commodities, including wheat/wheat flour, yellow split peas and sunflower oil. Approximately 8 percent of all wheat flour procured was previously sourced from Russia. WFP is urgently working on new procurement contracts with neighbouring countries to fill the gap. The feasibility study of opening a supply route from India through Iran is underway. WFP is facing lead times of up to 6 months for internationally procured commodities. Due to the impact of the crisis in Ukraine on global food and fuel prices, WFP requires USD 256 million more for food and transport in 2022. A shortfall of wheat flour is expected in July through the end of the year, as the 2023 lean season preparations begin. Shortfalls are primarily due to regional export bans and WFP is working to contract alternative sources.",

                countryName: "Bangladesh",
                fsnNarrative: "Bangladesh was the third major export market for both Russian and Ukrainian wheat in 2020-21, importing 1.51 million mt of wheat from Ukraine and 1.94 million mt from Russia. On 13 May, India then banned domestic exports of wheat and onion, which – on top of the conflict – have sent local market prices spiralling upwards in Cox’s Bazar. Before Indonesia banned the export of palm oil, 80 percent of Bangladeshi palm oil imports were sourced from Indonesia. The inflation rate reached 6.24 percent in April 2022 and is expected to increase further in the second quarter of 2022. Refugees already spend an average of 52 percent of their e-voucher entitlement on rice. If their current purchasing power is not maintained, WFP expects to see refugees spend a higher proportion of their entitlement on energy-dense cereals to minimize food costs, as opposed to micronutrient-rich fresh fruits, vegetables, and animal proteins. ",
                wfpNarrative: "Adjusting the existing food monthly expenditure basket (MEB) for the April rate of inflation means an increase from USD 15.50 per person (established in November 2020) to USD 16.50 per person. The rising cost of wheat will likely increase the cost of WSB+/WSB++ and will require WFP to either reduce the ration size or reduce the number of participants in its nutrition programmes, unless additional donor support is secured. In May 2022, WFP had to abruptly provide a mid-month top-up to refugee households in the camps, due to a sudden nation-wide price hike in vegetable oil. WFP is exploring the deployment of various solutions (individually or in parallel) to protect refugees’ purchasing power in Cox’s Bazar as much as possible, including: 1) Increase transfer value, where possible; 2) Deduct at-risk item(s) from value voucher and distribute directly to refugees (e.g., 1L of oil per person per month); 3) Maintain the same prices for refugees at outlet-level, but WFP to pay the market price difference to retailers directly; 4) Increase market research capacity to forecast at-risk items in advance (where possible) to provide more lead time to temporarily switch to in-kind, where necessary; 5) Assess the viability of alternative commodities to at-risk items, while maintaining nutritional value.",
                stakeholderNarrative: "So far, there has been no change in the Government's plan and allocation for social safety net programmes in Bangladesh. To support the poor and vulnerable, the Government has increased the selling of essential commodities at a reduced price in addition to open market sales of rice.",

The month-on-month change has also increased slightly in March, mainly due to the 13 percent increase in the price of petrol and diesel. Food prices went up by 4.01 percent contributing to 36 percent of the overall inflation rate. Vegetables increased by 5.41 percent from previous month contributing to 0.57 percent increase for food groups. Among non-food items, transport recorded the highest increase, mostly attributed to the increase in price of petrol & diesel by about 40 percent from last year. (Bhutan Consumer Price Index) ",

                stakeholderNarrative: "WFP is supporting the construction of kitchens and stores to many schools, which will be impacted by fuel and steel price increases.

                fsnNarrative: "Since average Cambodian households spends around half of their available income on food, rising prices for foods (especially for imports such as vegetable oil and vegetables) and inputs for food production (fuel, fertilizer) may result in affordability issues. Rising prices may also result in lower food production and availability as farming profit is shrinking. Both mechanisms will have adverse effects on household food security.",
                wfpNarrative: "WFP is increasing monitoring of the repercussions of the conflict in Ukraine on market functionality, prices and household food security through regular market updates and high-frequency household surveys. WFP is also developing a trade profile of Cambodia-Russia-Ukraine to better assess potential weak spots in import export flows. WFP is in discussions with UNCT and FAO to set up comprehensive food systems monitoring.",
                stakeholderNarrative: "UNCT has launched a task force to analyse the effects of the conflict in Ukraine crisis. The Government has passed a degree that foresees the shortening of the petrol price adjustment from 15 to 10 days to reflect international price volatility and maintain stability in fuel supplies.",

Despite the conflict in Ukraine, domestic supplies have been maintained and wheat flour prices have not recorded a significant increase (only 1.7 percent between February and March). Global supply disruptions should be continually monitored as this may affect local wheat prices in the medium to long-term. In March 2022, the price of cooking oil increased more than 30 percent in all regions of Indonesia compared with the previous year, with Sulawesi recording over 63 percent higher prices. Indonesia imposed a temporary ban on exports of crude and refined palm oil on 28 April in an attempt to lower cooking oil prices for domestic consumers as companies sought to export palm oil to fill the gap of Ukrainian and Russian sunflower oil. The ban was revoked 23 May and replaced with a Domestic Market Obligation requirement for companies. ",
                wfpNarrative: "WFP will continue to closely monitor the evolving situation of food commodity prices and the interventions implemented by the Government of Indonesia. Should the situation change, WFP may produce an updated Food Price Bulletin in the coming months based on secondary data analysis. \r\nWFP is also working with the Coordinating Ministry of Human Development and Cultural Affairs to facilitate the formation of a working group for essential goods and a national supply chain coordination platform for dialogue on supply chain issues. The working group and supply chain coordination platform aim to discuss and mitigate current and future supply chain disruptions to essential goods, including those potentially triggered by the conflict in Ukraine.",
                stakeholderNarrative: "The Government of Indonesia is committed to maintaining the national inflation rate between 2-5 percent. To do so, the National Food Agency (NFA) – one of WFP’s main partners – must maintain food stock availability and food prices. As per usual, the NFA is continuing to closely monitor the food stock and prices of the nine strategic commodities in Indonesia and providing transparency of data on their platform. Moreover, one of the interventions put in place by the NFA to prevent a rise in food prices is to provide a subsidy for maize and soybean producers. ",

                fsnNarrative: " The Kyrgyz Republic has a high dependency on Russian imports and imports 95 percent, 81 percent and 99 percent of its imported wheat, vegetable oil and sugar, respectively, from the Russian Federation. In April 2022, inflation reached 14.5 percent compared with April 2021, the highest in the Eurasian Economic Union (EAEU) countries, and food inflation for staples is nearing 20 percent (Jan-April 2022 compared with the same period last year). While fuel prices appeared to remain somewhat constant between February 2022 to May 2022, they remain over 60 percent higher than in February 2021. Rising input costs (e.g., fertilizers) could impact next season’s harvest, leading to elevated food prices in the longer run. Additionally, the Kyrgyz economy is highly dependent on remittances, which made up 31 percent of the country’s economy (GDP) in 2020 and has been an important contributor to reducing the national poverty rate. Remittances from the Russian Federation make up 80 percent of all remittances to the country. Due to the recent sanctions on the Russian Federation, a drop of 33 percent in remittances to the Kyrgyz Republic is predicted for 2022, which may increase the poverty rate from 25 percent to up to 38 percent in 2022 (World Bank), increasing the need for nutrition-sensitive shock-responsive social protection for a larger portion of the population.",
                wfpNarrative: "Additional funding may be required to procure wheat flour and oil from Russia at a higher cost. WFP will continue to monitor market prices for key commodities, including food and fuel, and work with national and local partners to tailor programmes to the needs of the most vulnerable and food insecure. WFP is exploring options to mitigate the increased cost of programme implementation. This may include increasing advocacy government contributions to be adjusted against inflation or another index (i.e., indexation of contributions), formalizing community contributions, prioritizing criteria to inform the type and extent of WFP assistance,  re-evaluating food rations and transfer values, and actively fundraising for the Emergency Response Outcome 5 introduced in the COVID-19 response to scale-up CBT and social protection support, in case of further shocks to vulnerable populations. WFP also provided policy and technical support to replicate the piloted Social Contract nationwide, and is supporting the government to develop a policy framework for the “Meken Chakyrygy” public works programme of the state anti-crises plan. ",
                stakeholderNarrative: "On 12 March 2022, the Government adopted an anti-crisis plan of KGS 126 billion (USD 1.58 billion), which includes subsidies for agriculture credits, land tax exemptions, wheat grain and flour import tax exemptions, bans on the export of basic food commodities, a nationwide programme of paid public works “Meken Chakyrygy” to provide temporary employment for hundreds of thousands of people, and increase social benefits and salaries of employees such as social workers.",

In February 2022 the retail price for fuel rose by 53 percent (year-on-year) which is a record high in the past decade. This has serious implications on the food security situation of some households in the country because of the weak purchasing power and availability of imported goods due to the increase in food and fuel prices and the stagnant salaries for the civil servants. In addition, the significant depreciation of the Lao Kip against the US dollar (more than 30 percent compared with a year ago) and the Thai baht are exacerbating inflation levels in Lao PDR and exposes some households to weak purchasing power, ultimately impacting the quality and quantity of households’ diets.",
                wfpNarrative: "As a result of the crisis, WFP’s procurement of fortified cooking oil for school feeding has been delayed, resulting in the possible need to reallocate internal commodities to cover this need. Given the impacts on food and fuel prices, WFP is updating the Minimum Expenditure Basket to better inform needs and transfer values. WFP and its partners will consider assessments and monitoring for poor urban dwellers as they are likely to be disproportionately affected due to their heavy reliance on markets. In terms of direct response, WFP will consider scaling climate-risk management approaches and shock-responsive social protection through access to low-cost loans/grants for agriculture.",

The increase in fuel prices has caused transport costs to rise – a key driver of increasing retail food prices. The cost of a basic food basket increased by 14 percent between February and April and is 31 percent higher than a year ago. Edible oil prices have risen by 37 percent between January and April, due to high transport costs, volatility in local exchange rates, and conflict in Myanmar. The average price of rice increased 10 percent from January to April with rising prices felt nearly everywhere in the country. Rising fertilizer prices could drive food prices higher still; while Myanmar mainly imports fertilizer from China, the conflict in Ukraine is expected to have knock-on effects on the availability and price of fertilizer in Myanmar.",
                wfpNarrative: "WFP will continue to use its monthly market updates to monitor the costs of food and fuel, and work with field offices and partners to identify potential activity adaptations. These may include adjusting transport contracts and increasing the value of cash-based transfers to meet the basic needs of beneficiaries. WFP also continues to allow more lead time for the procurement of food and nutrition rations. A potential risk of rising prices is that WFP will need to procure rice and other commodities from international markets at a higher cost. This would require additional funding or reducing relief assistance coverage.",
                stakeholderNarrative: " WFP Myanmar is not partnering with the de facto authorities on programming. The Myanmar Food Security Cluster, housed within WFP, continues to monitor food security in the country. Their research shows that in Myanmar it is difficult to separate the impact of the Ukraine conflict from the ongoing impacts of the military takeover in February 2021 and lingering effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. The Cluster has advised partners to expect an increase in costs of up to 40 percent and to budget accordingly. Cluster leads are also concerned that rising costs will increase activity support costs, which will require budget adjustments that may have a negative impact on the number of beneficiaries reached in 2022. Further, with the Humanitarian Response Plan critically underfunded in 2022, Cluster partners may have to reduce staff numbers. If so, it is likely to be even more difficult for them to implement food security initiatives without adequate staff support.",

                fsnNarrative: "While Nepal’s direct exposure to Russia and Ukraine is largely limited, rising food and fuel prices, export bans, and supply chain limitations for cereals, vegetable oils and fertilizers could negatively impact food supply and ultimately push food even further out of reach for the most vulnerable people. Year-on-year inflation as measured by the Consumer Price Index (CPI) has risen to 7.28 percent from 7.14 percent in March, while food inflation also increased by 7.4 percent, with significant increases for ghee and edible oils (28.36 percent), as well as milk products and eggs (11.56 percent).Since the beginning of the year, prices of petroleum products, including fuel and gas have increased by 48 percent across the country. The Nepal Oil Corporation – the only provider of petroleum products in Nepal – continues to increase prices every fortnight.   Nepal is one of the top export destinations for Indian wheat, and the impact of India’s wheat export ban could emerge in the next three months. The 2022 monsoon season is also predicted to be above average, which will contribute to increased food insecurity along with rising prices.",
                wfpNarrative: "Immediate impacts on WFP operations will include delays in procurement and increased in the cost of operations, constraining WFP’s ability to respond. In addition, the rising costs of fuel will surge food prices affecting vulnerable communities in hard-to-reach areas in WFP programmes such as the mother and child health and nutrition programme. WFP will continue with regularly monthly monitoring, as well as additional rapid market monitoring in-house where to look at key market functionality (supply, demand, availability, transport), prices aas well as macro indicators. Primary data will be collected after the elections and released in early June. WFP’s mVAM household survey round is scheduled to be ready by July, with data collection planned for end of May to June. This survey will provide a picture on the prevalence of food insecurity in Nepal.  Previous reports available below.",

                fsnNarrative: "The conflict in Ukraine will exacerbate the food security impacts of the recent intense heatwaves, which have disrupted livelihoods and damaged summer crops such as wheat and pulses. Experts fear that the country’s wheat production may fall short of the 30 million tonnes required.The Pakistani rupee has depreciated more than 21 percent year-on-year, and the resultant economic impact is likely to hit the poorest segments of the economy the most. Headline inflation based on the Consumer Price Index (CPI) increased in April 2022 by 1.61 percent over March 2022 and increased by 13.37 percent over April 2021. CPI food inflation in April 2022 increased by 17.04 percent over April 2021. (Further information is available in the Market Monitor Report for May 2022). As yet, the outlook provided by the Ministry of Agriculture remains positive, indicating nearly adequate availability of food to meet the country’s need. However, against a backdrop of high levels of food security and undernutrition, weak food systems and significant disparities in the access and availability of food, there are serious concerns, particularly for the poor and marginalized population groups of across the country",
                wfpNarrative: "The crisis has led to supply disruptions, which have seriously impacted the availability of fortified vegetable oil for WFP’s standard food basket, and in some cases, oil will not be distributed along with the food rations (thereby resulting in a decline in its caloric and monetary value). Rising food prices have also devalued cash disbursements being made under WFP’s CBT programmes. The cost of WFP’s food basket has also increased by 30 percent since January 2022. \r\nWhile WFP in Pakistan rarely needs to import wheat internationally for its operations, the expected shortage could lead to a need for further wheat imports. The substantial hike in global wheat prices could have implications for WFP’s food basket in Pakistan as well.",
                stakeholderNarrative: "The value of the stipend provided to the poorest quintile of the population registered in the Kafaalat component of the Government’s largest social safety net programme, the Benazir Income Support Programme (BISP) has declined exponentially. WFP and other humanitarian organizations have made recommendations to the new Government’s availability of funds for the poorest quintile through BISP Kafaalat (as was done in the immediate aftermath of COVID-19). In order to protect current development gains and prevent more people from being pushed into chronic food insecurity status, WFP is continuing engagement with the National Socio-Economic Registry (NSER) to incorporate the latest Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) information into targeting and programming for the BISP. This will maximize the prospects of inclusion for the most affected and vulnerable families for support, thereby circumventing a further deterioration in their food and nutrition security.",

Several events (not all directly related to Ukraine) have led to food inflation skyrocketing to 46.6 percent in April 2022, and the currency losing more than 80 percent of its value. Multiple factors are colliding to amplify the pressure, from unfavourable harvests and widespread shortages of key imported commodities to extremely volatile prices. The global economic crisis is set to only exacerbate the situation. An estimated 4.9 million people – 22 percent of the population – are food insecure and need external assistance. Low-income households are hardest hit, and some 86 percent of surveyed households are already turning to negative coping strategies such as buying cheaper food, reducing portions or skipping meals (according to the latest WFP-Government joint assessments).",
