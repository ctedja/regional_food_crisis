                fsnNarrative: "Ripple effects from the crisis in Ukraine threaten to deepen the food security crisis in Afghanistan, as the price of basic food commodities, fuel, and agricultural inputs surge. The price of wheat flour has increased by 24 percent since October 2021, while vegetable oil increased by 41 percent since March 2022 alone. ",
                wfpNarrative: "As a result, the cost of WFP’s commodity voucher food basket has increased by 17 percent since December 2021. WFP is experiencing, on average, a 4-6 month lead time for the procurement of food commodities, including wheat/wheat flour, yellow split peas and sunflower oil. Approximately 8 percent of all wheat flour procured was previously sourced from Russia. WFP is urgently working on new procurement contracts with neighbouring countries to fill the gap. The feasibility study of opening a supply route from India through Iran is underway.\r\n<br><br>\r\nDue to the impact of the crisis in Ukraine on global food and fuel prices, WFP requires USD 256 million more for food and transport in 2022. A shortfall of wheat flour is expected in July through the end of the year, as the 2023 lean season preparations begin. Shortfalls are primarily due to regional export bans and WFP is working to contract alternative sources.",

                countryName: "Bangladesh",
                fsnNarrative: "Bangladesh was the third major export market for both Russian and Ukrainian wheat in 2020-21, importing 1.51 million mt of wheat from Ukraine and 1.94 million mt from Russia. On 13 May, India then banned domestic exports of wheat and onion seeds, which – on top of the conflict – have sent local market prices spiralling upwards in Cox’s Bazar. Before Indonesia temporarily banned the export of palm oil, 80 percent of Bangladeshi palm oil imports were sourced from Indonesia. \r\n<br><br>\r\nThe inflation rate reached 6.24 percent in April 2022 and is expected to increase further in the second quarter of 2022. Refugees already spend an average of 52 percent of their e-voucher entitlement on rice. If their current purchasing power is not maintained, WFP expects to see refugees spend a higher proportion of their entitlement on energy-dense cereals to minimize food costs, as opposed to micronutrient-rich fresh fruits, vegetables, and animal proteins. ",
                wfpNarrative: "Adjusting the existing food monthly expenditure basket (MEB) for the April rate of inflation means an increase from USD 15.50 per person (established in November 2020) to USD 16.50 per person. The rising cost of wheat will likely increase the cost of WSB+/WSB++ and will require WFP to either reduce the ration size or reduce the number of participants in its nutrition programmes, unless additional donor support is secured. In May 2022, WFP had to abruptly provide a mid-month top-up to refugee households in the camps, due to a sudden nation-wide price hike in vegetable oil.\r\n<br><br>\r\nWFP is exploring the deployment of various solutions (individually or in parallel) to protect refugees’ purchasing power in Cox’s Bazar as much as possible, including: 1) Increase transfer value, where possible; 2) Deduct at-risk item(s) from value voucher and distribute directly to refugees (e.g., 1L of oil per person per month); 3) Maintain the same prices for refugees at outlet-level, but WFP to pay the market price difference to retailers directly; 4) Increase market research capacity to forecast at-risk items in advance (where possible) to provide more lead time to temporarily switch to in-kind, where necessary; 5) Assess the viability of alternative commodities to at-risk items, while maintaining nutritional value.",
                stakeholderNarrative: "So far, there has been no change in the Government's plan and allocation for social safety net programmes in Bangladesh. To support the poor and vulnerable, the Government has increased the selling of essential commodities at a reduced price in addition to open market sales of rice.",

The latest survey data (COVID-19 SEIA) shows a deterioration in some FSN indicators (FCS and FCS-N), particularly among urban populations. Rising prices may also result in lower food production and availability as farming profit is shrinking. Both mechanisms will have adverse effects on household food security and nutrition.",
                wfpNarrative: "WFP is increasing monitoring of the repercussions of the conflict in Ukraine on market functionality, prices and household food security and nutrition through an expansion of regular market updates and high-frequency household surveys, funded under a Joint UN SDG grant. WFP also developed a trade profile of Cambodia-Russia-Ukraine to better assess potential weak spots in import export flows. WFP is working with UNCT to set up comprehensive food systems monitoring, including joint policy briefs for the Government including updates on the macro-economic context, food production, market prices, and access to food.\r\n<br><br>\r\nThe crisis will also likely impact government programmes, and drive down the value of cash transfers due to price increases and inflation, especially since current cash values are determined by the previous MEB. WFP is working on a new MEB and sector-specific transfer values to provide evidence to increase the cash package to households.",
                stakeholderNarrative: "UNCT has launched a task force to analyse the effects of the conflict in Ukraine crisis. UNCT has successfully applied to an UN SDG fund to enhance its joint monitoring of the looming cost-of-living crisis in Cambodia. The Government has passed a degree that foresees the shortening of the petrol price adjustment from 15 to 10 days to reflect international price volatility and maintain stability in fuel supplies.",

                fsnNarrative: "Indonesia is fully dependent on wheat imports. Ukraine is the second biggest source of wheat after Australia. The domestic price of wheat flour in Indonesia recorded a consistent increase from January to May 2022. Even before the Russian-Ukrainian conflict, the price of wheat flour in Indonesia was already on the rise due to crop failures globally. Since the start of the conflict, domestic wheat flour prices have recorded a 7.5 percent weekly increase (third week of February vs. fifth week of May). The war in Ukraine could potentially have a knock-on effect on wheat supplies and prices in Indonesia, which will need to be closely monitored in the short and medium-term. In order to limit the impact on prices of domestic wheat products such as noodles and wheat flour, Indonesia is already looking for alternative countries to import wheat from, including Argentina, Brazil, Canada, USA, Moldova, and Bulgaria. \r\n<br><br>\r\nThe annual inflation in May reached 3.55 percent, a new record high. However, the monthly comparison shows that inflation declined from 0.95 percent in April to 0.40 percent in May. In May, vegetable oil was no longer increasing inflation as recorded in March-April. Instead, the prices of chicken, eggs and shallots were found as the main drivers of inflation. Furthermore, the price of cooking oil remained stable compared to April. However, the current price level (IDR 24,270/kg) is still high compared to May 2021 (IDR 15,000/kg) and still higher than the ceiling price (IDR 15,500/kg).",
                wfpNarrative: "WFP will continue to closely monitor the evolving situation of food commodity prices and the interventions implemented by the Government of Indonesia. Should the situation change, WFP may produce an updated Food Price Bulletin in the coming months based on secondary data analysis. WFP is also working with the Coordinating Ministry of Human Development and Cultural Affairs to facilitate the formation of a working group for essential goods and a national supply chain coordination platform for dialogue on supply chain issues. The working group and supply chain coordination platform aim to discuss and mitigate current and future supply chain disruptions to essential goods, including those potentially triggered by the conflict in Ukraine.",
                stakeholderNarrative: "The Government of Indonesia is committed to maintaining the national inflation rate between 2-5 percent. To do so, the National Food Agency (NFA) – one of WFP’s main partners – must maintain food stock availability and food prices. As per usual, the NFA is continuing to closely monitor the food stock and prices of the nine strategic commodities in Indonesia and providing transparency of data on their platform. To control the price of certain strategic food commodities, the NFA is redistributing stocks of certain commodities from areas with surplus of stock to areas with low of stocks.\r\n<br><br>\r\nThe Government is also continuing to implement the Unconditional Cash Transfer (BLT) for Cooking Oil (BLT Minyak Goreng) scheme to improve households’ and small street vendors’ purchasing power. The BLT scheme has been implemented since April and will end in June with advance disbursements equivalent to IDR 300,000.",

                fsnNarrative: "The conflict is exacerbating existing stresses following the recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic, which had eroded the resilience of the most vulnerable households. Rising food prices and inflation are negatively affecting the ability of the poorest households, who already spend more than half of their budget on food, to access a nutritious diet. Overall, the situation remains highly volatile as many unknowns remain on future developments.\r\n<br><br>\r\nIn May 2022, inflation reached 14 percent compared with May 2021, the highest in the Eurasian Economic Union (EAEU) countries, and food inflation for staples is nearing 20 percent (Jan-May 2022 compared with the same period last year). While fuel prices appeared to remain somewhat constant between February 2022 to June 2022, they remain over 60 percent higher than in February 2021. The Kyrgyz Republic does not produce mineral fertilizers and it imports it from Uzbekistan, the Russian Federation and Kazakhstan. Rising input costs (e.g., fertilizers) could impact next season’s harvest, leading to elevated food prices in the longer run. Moreover, the Kyrgyz Republic has a high dependency on imports: 30 percent for wheat, 84 percent for vegetable oil and 37 percent for sugar. Out of the imported wheat, vegetable oil and sugar, 95 percent, 81 percent and 99 percent respectively comes from the Russian Federation. The high dependency on Russian imports exposes the country to increased vulnerability to shocks and volatility.\r\n<br><br>\r\nAdditionally, the Kyrgyz economy is highly dependent on remittances, which made up 31 percent of the country’s economy (GDP) in 2020 and has been an important contributor to reducing the national poverty rate. Remittances from the Russian Federation make up 80 percent of all remittances to the country. Due to the recent sanctions on the Russian Federation, a drop of 33 percent in remittances to the Kyrgyz Republic is predicted for 2022, which may increase the poverty rate from 25 percent to up to 38 percent in 2022 (World Bank), increasing the need for nutrition-sensitive shock-responsive social protection for a larger portion of the population.",
                wfpNarrative: "WFP will continue to monitor market prices for key commodities, including food and fuel, and work with national and local partners to tailor programmes to the needs of the most vulnerable and food insecure. \r\n<br><br>\r\nWFP is exploring options to mitigate the increased cost of programme implementation. Under the Optimisation of the School Meals Programme (Outcome 1), this may include increasing advocacy for government contributions to be adjusted against inflation or another index (i.e., indexation of contributions) and formalizing parental contributions. Under the other outcomes (2,3,5), WFP is actively fundraising and writing proposals to scale up CBT and social protection to mitigate the impact of the crises on the most vulnerable. The country office, in collaboration with UNDP, FAO and UNICEF, will conduct a household survey on the impact of the crisis on households to assess their food security and resilience among others.  \r\n<br><br>\r\nUnder WFP’s food assistance for assets and food assistance for training activities, WFP is prioritizing assets and trainings with clear and direct linkages to improved food security. WFP also provided policy and technical support to replicate the piloted Social Contract nationwide, and is supporting the government to develop a policy framework for the “Meken Chakyrygy” public works programme of the state anti-crises plan.",
                stakeholderNarrative: "On 12 March 2022, the Government adopted an anti-crisis plan of KGS 126 billion (USD 1.58 billion), which includes subsidies for agriculture credits, land tax exemptions, wheat grain and flour import tax exemptions, bans on the export of basic food commodities, a nationwide programme of paid public works “Meken Chakyrygy” to provide temporary employment for hundreds of thousands of people, and increase social benefits and salaries of employees such as social workers.",

In April 2022, the retail price for diesel increased by 13 percent from the previous month of March 2022. This has serious implications on the food security situation of some households because of the weak purchasing power and availability of imported goods, and stagnant salaries for civil servants. In addition, the record depreciation of the Lao Kip against the US dollar and the Thai baht are exacerbating inflation levels in Lao PDR and exposing some households to weak purchasing power, ultimately impacting the quality and quantity of households’ diets. The country’s full reopening to tourism from May is fuelling hopes of income generation for the dented tourism sector.",
                wfpNarrative: "As a result of the crisis, WFP’s procurement of fortified cooking oil for school feeding was delayed. Given the impacts on food and fuel prices, WFP is updating the Minimum Expenditure Basket to better inform needs and transfer values. WFP is setting up a food security monitoring system through mVAM which is likely to target both rural and urban dwellers. In addition to the mVAM, WFP is also collecting market prices. \r\n<br><br>\r\nIn terms of direct response, WFP will consider scaling climate-risk management approaches and shock-responsive social protection through access to low-cost loans/grants for agriculture. Should the situation deteriorate and there arise a need for emergency food assistance, the country office has secured in-kind and cash-based transfers to respond to possible shocks/disasters. This includes 1,700 MT of in-kind rice which could provide temporary relief to approximately 20,000-25,000 beneficiaries in 2022-2023, plus a high probability of an additional 1,300 MT of rice for 2023-2024. This also includes USD 200,000 to support a potential small-scale cash-based transfer response. ",
                stakeholderNarrative: "WFP is working with the Rome-based agencies to conduct a  joint assessment of the situation. In addition, WFP Lao PDR is working on developing an internal price monitoring and market functionality assessment. The Bank of Laos is responding to the crisis by controlling the parallel markets foreign exchange transactions; in the past few months there was a significant difference between the official exchange rate and the parallel market exchange rates. With the strict measures imposed by the government, no parallel market is allowed to change outside of the permitted official rates.",

The increase in fuel prices has caused transport costs to rise – a key driver of increasing retail food prices. The cost of a basic food basket increased by 14 percent between February and April and is 31 percent higher than a year ago. Edible oil prices have risen by 37 percent between January and April, due to high transport costs, volatility in local exchange rates, and conflict in Myanmar. The average price of rice increased 10 percent from January to April with rising prices felt nearly everywhere in the country. Rising fertilizer prices could drive food prices higher still; while Myanmar mainly imports fertilizer from China, the conflict in Ukraine is expected to have knock-on effects on the availability and price of fertilizer in Myanmar.",
                wfpNarrative: "WFP will continue to use its monthly market updates to monitor the costs of food and fuel, and work with field offices and partners to identify potential activity adaptations. These may include adjusting transport contracts and increasing the value of cash-based transfers to meet the basic needs of beneficiaries. WFP also continues to allow more lead time for the procurement of food and nutrition rations. A potential risk of rising prices is that WFP will need to procure rice and other commodities from international markets at a higher cost. This would require additional funding or reducing relief assistance coverage.",
                stakeholderNarrative: "WFP Myanmar is not partnering with the de facto authorities on programming. The Myanmar Food Security Cluster, housed within WFP, continues to monitor food security in the country. Their research shows that in Myanmar it is difficult to separate the impact of the Ukraine conflict from the ongoing impacts of the military takeover in February 2021 and lingering effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. The Cluster has advised partners to expect an increase in costs of up to 40 percent and to budget accordingly. Cluster leads are also concerned that rising costs will increase activity support costs, which will require budget adjustments that may have a negative impact on the number of beneficiaries reached in 2022. Further, with the Humanitarian Response Plan critically underfunded in 2022, Cluster partners may have to reduce staff numbers. If so, it is likely to be even more difficult for them to implement food security initiatives without adequate staff support.",

Overall, the increases can be largely explained by the impact of the conflict in Ukraine on Nepal’s retail markets, the shortage of some food commodities, and the increase in fuel prices and transportation costs. Supply and transportation of goods to markets remained stable; however, increase in transportation costs has been observed in all surveyed districts. Export bans imposed by India, including on wheat and sugar, are also increasing prices and have knock-on effects, for example on the cost of poultry and eggs, as although Nepal is self-sufficient in both, the soybean, wheat and corn used as chicken feed are imported. The early and above average 2022 monsoon season will also likely contribute to increased food insecurity along with rising prices.",
                wfpNarrative: "Immediate impacts on WFP operations will include delays in procurement and increased in the cost of operations, constraining WFP’s ability to respond. In addition, the rising costs of fuel will drive a surge in food prices, affecting vulnerable communities in hard-to-reach areas for WFP programmes such as the mother and child health and nutrition programme. \r\n<br><br>\r\nWFP will continue with regularly monthly monitoring, as well as additional rapid market monitoring in-house where to look at key market functionality (supply, demand, availability, transport), prices as well as macro indicators. Primary data will be collected after the elections and released in early June. WFP’s mVAM household survey round is scheduled to be ready by July, with data collection planned for end of May to June. This survey will provide a picture on the prevalence of food insecurity in Nepal. Previous reports available below. WFP is also proposing to conduct a study to help fill the data gap on the impact of the conflict at the household level to inform policies and crisis response.

The volatility of the current price change of countries’ goods and services could largely be due to other factors such as commodity markets, policy changes or seasonal or infrequent price setting as experienced by the current supply chain across the globe. Rising farm inputs such as fertilizers will most likely impact the next season’s harvest, which could also lead to increases in food prices in the longer term. One of the Pacific countries that WFP is not monitoring through mVAM, the Solomon Islands, is of particular concern, with a high level of food insecurity, high financial vulnerability and low levels of income.",

As yet, the outlook provided by the Ministry of Agriculture remains positive, indicating nearly adequate availability of food to meet the country’s need.

                wfpNarrative: "The crisis has led to supply disruptions, which have seriously impacted the availability of fortified vegetable oil for WFP’s standard food basket, and in some cases, oil will not be distributed along with the food rations (thereby resulting in a decline in its caloric and monetary value). Rising food prices have also devalued cash disbursements being made under WFP’s CBT programmes. The cost of WFP’s food basket has also increased by 30 percent since January 2022. \r\nWhile WFP in Pakistan rarely needs to import wheat internationally for its operations, the expected shortage could lead to a need for further wheat imports.

Multiple factors are colliding to amplify the pressure, from unfavourable harvests (most recent rice harvest is 50 percent lower than normal) and widespread shortages of key imported commodities (200 essential medicines are out of stock and fuel stocks have prompted closures/suspension of schools and some government offices) to extremely volatile prices.

The first quarter of 2022 has seen a drop by nearly 54 percent in cooking oil imports compared to the previous period, on account of reduced global supply coupled with the recent trade bans in Indonesia. Cooking oil prices increased by 17 percent within the month of April and a further 54 percent compared with a year ago. ",
                wfpNarrative: "At the beginning of the global pandemic in early 2020, WFP started to support the Government in monitoring daily market prices on staple food commodities and nationwide fuel coverage; this included successfully introducing standardized questionnaires and collection methodology. Currently, MAF’s food security focal points in 13 municipalities monitor the prices of 16 food items.\r\n<br><br>\r\nWFP is continuing this price monitoring, to capture the effects of the war in Ukraine on escalating commodity prices, including food items, and the impact of supply chain challenges in Timor-Leste due to the palm oil export ban from Indonesia. WFP provided price monitoring data capturing the price spike of cooking oil and fuel to the relevant line ministries and partners. WFP is keeping a closer look at the prices to ensure that inflation won’t disrupt family spending and essential good affordability. Considering the high level of global uncertainty, including the ongoing crisis in Ukraine, WFP together with the Government of Timor-Leste, will continue to monitor food and non-food item prices to respond to food security needs in the country. ",
                stakeholderNarrative: "WFP, together with the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries (MAF), General Directorate of Statistics(GDS), and private-sector suppliers, held the market dynamic meeting to grasp the ongoing fuel increase in April. WFP with the MAF completed a rapid market assessment in three municipalities to assess the functionality of markets. With the European Union's support, a local NGO quarterly collects price data in the capital region.\r\n<br><br>\r\nWFP supports the Ministry of Tourism, Commerce, and Industry (MTCI) in monitoring the ongoing GoTL economic recovery scheme (Cesta Basica 2.0) to provide basic baskets through blanket distribution. WFP through the Ministry of Social Solidarity and Inclusion social protection program (Bolsa Da Mae) will fill the gap by General Food Distribution among the Pregnant and Lactating Women. \r\n<br><br>\r\nWFP also published a joint note with the World Bank on the macro impacts of the war in Ukraine on Timor-Leste.",
